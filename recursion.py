# recursion refers to a method or function that will call itself. it is used to resolved problems by breaking 
# the problem down into sub-problems.
# ############ recursive algorithms
# divide and conquer
# ### consists two parts, 1, breaking problem to sub-problems, 2, solving the final solution
# dynamic programming
# @@@ mainly used for optimization problems. similar to the divide and conquer algorithm in that it splits 
# the problems into sub-problems
# greedy alrgorithm
# @@@ finds the best solution in each and every step instead of approaching
# optimization in a global way
