# list comprehension - [ <expression> for x in <sequence> if <condition>] 

# dict comprehension - dict = { key:value for key, value in <sequence> if <condition> } 

# set comprehension - { <expression> for x in <sequence> if <condition>}

# generator comprehension - ( <expression> for x in <sequence> if <condition>)
